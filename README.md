On this proyect I will work on the next concepts:

- Git & Github Overflow
- Linters for HTML, CSS and JS
- Create Branch whit best practices
- Best practices of commiting
- Best practices for Pull Request

Live Demo (Work on progress).

## Working on my second day at Microverse!

### This is Day 2 at Microverse, and I'm learning a lot of things in so a short time. I'm so excited to continue learning and breaking obstacles in the path. The morning session was so useful to know each partner of this one, and I think that I will enjoy solving some problems whit them in the future.

There is the steps of the Day 2:

- Morning session: Core study skills part 1

- Test your knowledge: Microverse program requirements

- Linters

- Git & GitHub & GitHub Flow

- Document your repo in a professional way

**_Set up a "Hello Microverse" project_** **This is the actual step that I'm working on**

- Code review flow

- What does a code review really mean?

- 1.2 HTML5 semantic tags, box model and developer tools

- Images, Media and Backgrounds

- Daily standup
